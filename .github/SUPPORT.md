## Getting support and help

If you need support or help for bugs in Eris, please feel free to reach out to
@thoughtpolice here on GitHub by filing an issue in this repository, on IRC
(`irc.freenode.net`, channel `#nixos`), or by email (see my commit messages for
the details). Replies cannot always be guaranteed in a timely manner,
unfortunately.

It's possible a request you make is technically infeasible or requires work on
other components. If you're unsure of this, feel free to file an issue anyway
and something can be discussed.
