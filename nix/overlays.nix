# This should be a list of filepaths, each file containing a Nix overlay
# expression. Overlays are applied in exactly the order specified in this list,
# as ordering is relevant.
#
# You DO NOT need to call 'import' or any other such thing; just listing the
# filepaths here is enough for them to get picked up. Some examples are
# included.
